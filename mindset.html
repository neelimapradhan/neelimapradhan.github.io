          <h4 align="center"> "Very often when we fail or are fearful of failing, we want to
               believe that there’s some innate trait that we don’t possess, or
                that we’re just not special enough. But in reality, you are
                special enough. You can be persistent and disciplined just
                like anyone else. Whether your goal is to work at companies
                like Google, Facebook, etc, or to get into your dream
                law/medical school, or to start your own business, or to get
                better at public speaking, or to simply develop a happy and
                healthy lifestyle, there is no secret,
                there are no shortcuts — it all comes down to determination,
                consistency, and most importantly, discipline.
                The discipline to work hard, not when everyone is watching,
                but when absolutely no one is watching — when it’s just you and
                your character. That is the single attribute that makes all
                of the difference. The simple act of starting, failing,
                starting again, trying different approaches, persisting. " </h4>

            between two wolves inside us all. One is Evil. It is anger, jealousy,
             greed, resentment, inferiority, lies & ego. The other is Good.
             It is joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy, & truth.”⠀
            The boy thought about it, and asked, “Grandfather, which wolf wins?”
            The old man quietly replied, “The one you feed.” "</h4>
